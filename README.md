# Overview
`qcfitter` is an MPI parallelized, highly optimized quasar continuum fitter package built on the same algorithm as `picca`.

## The key differences
+ Coadding of spectrograph arms is optional and performed after continuum fitting.
+ Continuum is multiplied by a fiducial mean flux when provided.
+ You can pass fiducial var_lss (column `VAR`) and mean flux (column `MEANFLUX`) for observed wavelength `LAMBDA` in `STATS` extention of a FITS file. Wavelength should be linearly and equally spaced. This is the same format as rawio output from picca.
+ If no fiducial is passed, we fit only for var_lss (no eta fitting currently).
+ Internal weights for continuum fitting and coadding are based on smoothed `IVAR`, but output `WEIGHT` is *not* smoothed.
+ Chi2 information as well as best fits are saved in continuum_chi2_catalog.fits. Chi2 is calculated using smooth ivar and var_lss, and does not subtract sum of ln(weights).

## Similarities
+ Delta files are the same. `CONT` column is mean flux times continuum even when fiducial mean flux is passed.
+ `MEANSNR` in header file and chi2 catalog is average of flux times square root of positive ivar values. Header values are per arm, but catalog values are the average over all arms.

## Programs
Scripts under `bin` folder are executable. Pass `--help` for arguments. The most important ones are these four scripts:

+ [qcfit.py](bin/qcfit.py) performs picca-like continuum fitting. Runs on MPI, so on some machines you need to execute `srun -n 1 qcfit.py --help` for help.

## Source
+ [catalog.py](py/qcfitter/catalog.py) provides function to read catalog and broadcast from master pe. Needs following columns: `TARGETID, Z, TARGET_RA, RA, TARGET_DEC, DEC, SURVEY, HPXPIXEL, VMIN_CIV_450, VMAX_CIV_450, VMIN_CIV_2000, VMAX_CIV_2000`.
+ [masks.py](py/qcfitter/masks.py) provides maskers for sky, BAL and DLA. Sky mask is a simple text file, where colums are  'type' (unused), 'wave_min' mininum wavelength, 'wave_max' maximum wavelength, 'frame' rest-frame (RF) or observed (OBS). BAL mask assumes related `VMIN_CIV_450, VMAX_CIV_450, VMIN_CIV_2000, VMAX_CIV_2000` values are already present in `catalog`. DLA masking takes both Lya and Lyb profiles into account, masks `F<0.8` and corrects for the wings.
+ [mathtools.py](py/qcfitter/mathtools.py) hosts some functions and classes that are purely numerical.
+ [mpi_utils.py](py/qcfitter/mpi_utils.py) hosts MPI related functions such as logging.
+ [picca_continuum.py](py/qcfitter/picca_continuum.py) fits each quasar continuum with a global mean as done in picca.
+ [spectrum.py](py/qcfitter/spectrum.py) has `Spectrum` class that stores each quasar spectrum and provides io functions such as `read_spectra` and `save_deltas`.

# Installation
Create a conda environment and run `pip install -e .`. You may want to install required packages in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) while creating your conda environment, but pip should take care of it.

## NERSC
`mpi4py` needs special attention. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/parallel-python/#mpi4py-in-your-custom-conda-environment) to clone a mpi4py installed conda environment on NERSC.
