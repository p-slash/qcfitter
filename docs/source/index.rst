Welcome to qsonic's documentation!
====================================

.. include:: ../../README.rst

Programs
--------
+ ``qsonic-fit`` is the main continuum fitting script. It requires MPI. Each MPI task is responsible for independent sky regions based on HEALPix. Reading and fitting the continuum are done in parallel. After all quasars are fit with a continuum, all MPI tasks syncronize to calculate the mean continuum and check for convergence. See :ref:`here <qsonic fit arguments>` or execute ``qsonic-fit --help`` for help.
+ ``qsonic-calib`` calculates stacked flux, var_lss and eta terms for a given set of deltas. This script does not perform continuum fitting, and so, it enables fast calculations for data SNR splits, parameter variations in wavelength and variance binning. Also requires MPI. See :ref:`here <qsonic calib arguments>` ``qsonic-calib --help`` for help.

Note: Some platforms require these help commands to begin with ``mpirun -np 1`` or ``srun -n 1``.

Source
------
See :doc:`/generated/modules` for details.

+ `calibration.py` containes noise and flux calibration classes. Can be imported without MPI. The output file of the continuum fitting ``attibutes.fits`` can be used as an input for these calibrations. As an additional feature, large-scale variance term ``var_lss`` can be applied as an additive correction in noise calibration by passing ``--varlss-as-additive-noise``.
+ `catalog.py` provides function to read catalog and broadcast from master pe. Needs following columns: ``TARGETID, Z, TARGET_RA, RA, TARGET_DEC, DEC, SURVEY, HPXPIXEL, VMIN_CIV_450, VMAX_CIV_450, VMIN_CIV_2000, VMAX_CIV_2000``.
+ `io.py` module contains functions to read spectra and save deltas. Can be imported without MPI.
+ `masks.py` provides maskers for sky, BAL and DLA. Can be imported without MPI. Sky mask is a simple text file, where colums are  *type* (unused), *wave_min* mininum wavelength, *wave_max* maximum wavelength, *frame* rest-frame (RF) or observed (OBS). BAL mask assumes related ``VMIN_CIV_450, VMAX_CIV_450, VMIN_CIV_2000, VMAX_CIV_2000`` values are already present in `catalog`. DLA masking takes both Lya and Lyb profiles into account, masks ``F<0.8`` and corrects for the wings.
+ `mathtools.py` hosts some functions and classes that are purely numerical. Can be imported without MPI.
+ `mpi_utils.py` hosts MPI related functions such as logging. Can be imported without MPI.
+ `picca_continuum.py` fits each quasar continuum with a global mean as done in picca. Needs MPI.
+ `spectrum.py` has ``Spectrum`` class that stores each quasar spectrum. Can be imported without MPI.
